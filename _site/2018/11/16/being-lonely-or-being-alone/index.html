<p>If you are asked for absolutely no reason “Hey! How are you? “ , doesn’t matter you know me or not, doesn’t matter you’re taking a stroll or in a hurry, doesn’t matter you are in a good mood or not, your instinct will throw the very first answer as “I’m fine” Or “I’m good” Or “I’m OK!” (Pick your poison).</p>

<p>It might be an indication to a problem. A symptom.</p>

<p>There is this popular video on YouTube titled Simon Sinek on Millennial and Internet Addiction. If you can spare 20 minutes, please go and watch it before reading further. If you don’t want to watch, here are the key points he mentions:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Millennials(People born in 90s) could be characterized as the people grown under the influence of these 4 key factors:

1. Failed parenting strategies (Been told they can get anything they want, just because they want it. They can be anything!)

Effect: An entire generation that is growing up on failed self-esteem of previous generation

2.Internet (A life of filters, good at showing people that life is amazing even when one is depressed)

Effect: A dopamine driven lifestyle

3. Sense of Impatience (Grown in an age of instant gratification)

Effect: Failure to accept that it doesn’t work for job satisfaction and relationships

4. Environment ( Corporate preference for short term gain than long term life of young minds)

Effect: They end up thinking they lack the skill-set to develop in this environment
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now some of you might relate to all of what he said. Some will find a part of it relevant . But probably no one would discard everything being mentioned. The moment you acknowledge a coherence with any one of those issues, you should start to realize there IS some problem.</p>

<p>After graduating in mid-2016, I had 6 long months of doing substantially N.O.T.H.I.N.G. Travel ideas went to ashes because Gareebi (Poverty/Lack-of-Money). Having said that, there are 2 journeys every human must take :</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>‘One with the open eyes and one with closed’,
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>the latter was cheaper so, I did that and read and thought a lot. The beautiful thing about this process is that it starts with identification of difference between Being Lonely and Being Alone.</p>

<p>Sounds odd?? Bear with me!</p>

<p>‘Being Lonely’ is not a choice, it’s not a happy space for your mind to be, you don’t choose it; by the virtue of circumstances it has been forced upon you. ‘Being Alone’ however, is completely different and therapeutic.</p>

<p>2017, I moved to a different country and started talking to people from different age-groups, countries, cultural beliefs, socio-economic status, etc. At first idea of meeting new people, knowing different culture, does sound interesting and I don’t deny that it was great fun. Having said that, on careful observation though, you tend to find some similarities. Some obvious, some not-so-obvious.What am I talking about? What is it that I found?</p>

<p>Ok! So, I found out that root cause of most of people’s problems was consequentially because of Being lonely’(either at that time or some time in the past) rather than Being alone. Take a second here and do an honest evaluation that which of the above two categories you could associate most with.</p>

<p>Let’s address the elephant in the room properly now!</p>

<p>Loneliness Is As Bad For Your Health As Smoking 15 Cigarettes A Day.</p>

<p>Think of it in this way, if a person is lonely certainly at some point some sort of desperation will crawl in. Now, a desperate person is not in a position to choose but rather more willing to compromise.</p>

<p>Keeping the above in mind, now consider the resource intensive environment we have been nurtured in, this very word Compromise has a negative connotation.</p>

<p>A lore of ‘Follow your passion’ is fed &amp; injected into our brains since childhood, which would not have been so bad if only acceptance was taught along. So with this frame of mind, problems like these are inevitable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Been/Being in a physically or mentally abusive relationship</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Doubts about marriage</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seeking approval/reassurance/validation from relationships or peers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alcohol (Hey! you hiding in the veil of social drinking… you sure?), drugs, porn - addiction</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finding a balance between personal goals and family responsibility</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Doing a good job, good salary, good city still not content</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have amazing friends to hangout with but none could be relied upon</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Doing 100 things throughout the day, just so to not feel hollow and empty</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Staying in bed, trying to sleep but end up thinking 1000 useless thoughts</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You get the picture!</p>

<p>Wait Wait! The problem doesn’t end there.</p>

<p>As opportunistic as the world is today for a competent individual, it enforces a collective ideology of doing things fast.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Want to open start-up? Hurry up and take the first mover’s advantage”.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Want to become best in a field, put-in 10000 hours of work as quickly as you can”.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Like that guy/girl just quickly go and ask her out”.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You’re not married yet? Hurry up! the clock is ticking”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>End result, you end up being a person who thinks fast, not giving one’s brain enough time to evaluate and reflect. The most common consequence, you speak and do things that assure fruits-of-regret/guilt. Don’t have deeper and quality relationships in your life? You are stuck to something from past? Unsure about everything you wish to do? Humans dominate this planet because we thought faster than other species but:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>“There is more to life than increasing its speed.” -Mahatma Gandhi
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I am sorry if I am being the first person to throw light on something like this. A person driven by compromise and programmed to think fast is more likely to take impulsive not-so-smart decisions.</p>

<p>These are, as I mentioned earlier, just symptoms hinting to a potentially bigger emotional turmoil.</p>

<p>It’s rightly said:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>“All of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.” ― Blaise Pascal, Pensées
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When was the last time you sat quietly, without music or distraction and just experienced ‘being’?</p>

<p>Objectivity, will-power calibration are just some of the advantages of doing that but let’s keep that for some day.</p>

<p>Right now, what’s important is that if you haven’t done that there are good chances that you might be going through an emotional crisis. Something needs to be done about it. If you’re not facing any such issues, then great, skip to the last para straight away!</p>

<p>There is a need of developing a coping mechanism. To begin with, take the easiest step find a friend, a family member or a professional if need be. Sit and for once, talk. It might not change anything or solve anything but will give you enough assurance to proceed and identify steps to deal with it. Based on my small experience, I can almost assure you that many around you face the same issue, some better at hiding than the other. Open-up and you’ll see!</p>

<p>And yes, don’t be afraid of feeling stupid or a fool. It’s only human to feel vulnerable and in fact quite mature to accept that. It also gives other person an opportunity to be honest and as it follows mutual vulnerability fosters closeness, you might strengthen your relationship with the person.</p>

<p>If you don’t have any of these issues (and you’ve skipped the above paragraphs and jumped right on to here), then, first, go ahead and say thank you to your friends/family/partner, basically your support system. Once you’ve done that, please go and talk to people around you and give them an opportunity to speak, they might not have anyone to talk to or might be too hesitant to say personal stuff.You don’t have to judge them, you don’t necessarily need to even provide a solution, good-old listening works!</p>

<p>For once, make an effort to be the person you probably needed once.</p>

<p>The purpose of this post wasn’t to educate or lecture you but rather just strike a chord of awareness. Probably, about something that you already know.</p>

<p>A stitch in time, saves nine!</p>
